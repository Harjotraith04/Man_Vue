# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide - Kaggle Dataset Import

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** installed on your system
2. **Node.js** (already installed)
3. **Kaggle API credentials**

## Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
# Install kaggle package
pip install kaggle

# Or if you have multiple Python versions
python3 -m pip install kaggle
```

## Step 2: Set Up Kaggle Credentials

### Option A: Using Environment Variables (Recommended)
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_kaggle_username
KAGGLE_KEY=your_kaggle_api_key
```

### Option B: Using kaggle.json file
1. Go to [Kaggle Account Settings](https://www.kaggle.com/account)
2. Click "Create New API Token"
3. Download `kaggle.json`
4. Place it in `C:\Users\Sagar Jadhav\.kaggle\kaggle.json` (Windows)

## Step 3: Install Node.js Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## Step 4: Test Your Setup

```bash
npm run test-kaggle
```

## Step 5: Run the Import

### Option A: Easy Way (Windows)
```bash
# Double-click this file or run in terminal
scripts\run-import.bat
```

### Option B: Manual Steps
```bash
# 1. Test setup
npm run test-kaggle

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run import
npm run import-kaggle
```

### Option C: Via Admin Panel
1. Start your backend: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/admin/dataset` in your frontend
3. Click "Import Dataset"

## What Happens During Import

1. **Downloads** ~44,000 fashion products from Kaggle
2. **Processes** images and uploads to Cloudinary
3. **Creates** product records in MongoDB
4. **Shows** progress in console

**Estimated time**: 30-60 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Python Not Found
```bash
# Make sure Python is in your PATH
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

### Kaggle Authentication Failed
- Check your credentials in `.env` file
- Or verify `kaggle.json` file location

### Memory Issues
- The script processes in batches to avoid memory problems
- If issues persist, restart your computer
